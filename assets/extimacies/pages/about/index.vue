          Critical Theory from the Global South is a collaborative research
          project based at the American University in Cairo (Egypt), with
          partners at the American University of Beirut (Lebanon), the Federal
          University of ABC (Brazil), and the Ibero-American University
          (Mexico). The project is supported by a three-year, $500,000 grant
          awarded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation [2018-2021].

        <p class="m-5 base">
          The project seeks to think anew the north/south binary, rejecting the
          move to either “provincialize” Critical Theory or to “globalize” a
          southern perspective. Rather, the project proposes the notion of
          extimacy, a neologism coined by Jacques Lacan, which implies the
          topological space of an intimate exteriority or an internal
          externality, as a strategy to address the irreducibility of Critical
          Theory to either pole. From this point of view, the geopolitical and
          economic distinction between north and south, between what is proper
          to and inside the north and what is outside or external and other,
          begins to turn and twist into the edge of the möbius strip, where in
          this zone of indiscernibility, the inside becomes outside, the outside
          becomes inside, and the non-identical attains to identity. There,
          then, emerges the possibility of taking a position that is
          simultaneously inside and outside, identical and non-identical, in
          agreement and critical, within Critical Theory and outside it, of
          taking a position that is estimates, that is, of reconceiving Critical
          Theory beyond its liberal defense from the (imagined and real)
          standpoints of the north and its decolonial critique from the
          (imagined and real) standpoints of the south. As such, the project is
          centered on a series of colloquia, workshops, and publications that
          focus on rethinking the dichotomies of history and
          capitalist/non-capitalist modernity, progress and prolepsis,
          philosophies of consciousness and the unconscious, civilization and
          barbarism, nature and culture, metaphysics and materialism, the
          sensuous and the supra-sensuous, the universal and the particular,
          historical time and abstract time, theory and praxis, the center and
          the periphery.
