The course examines the affect of anxiety and its relationship to desire. The history of anxiety goes
back to ancient times, but it is only interrogated as a concept in modern thought (Keirkegaard,
existentialism), only to be re-theorized as an affect by psychoanalysis (Sigmund Freud and Jacques
Lacan). Modernity is an age of neurosis, in which anxiety emerges as an affect linked to the demand
for collective political solutions. The course investigates the importance of anxiety for thinking of
unconscious desires in contemporary society in the context of the rise of, politics of fear, populism,
and liberal notions of tolerance that arise to qualm anxiety and fear. If our present historical
moment is characterized as an ‘age of anxiety’ that is over-ridden with depression, suicide, and
paralysis, how can we rethink anxiety without resorting to quick tranquilizing resolutions? How do
we rethink affects of distress in contemporary society? In short: what are the links between a
psychoanalytic understanding of anxiety and politics?
