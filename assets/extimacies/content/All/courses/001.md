Spectacle and Revolt: Kristeva with Lacan, Debord, and Sartre. In her recent work, philosopher, psychoanalyst, and semiotician Julia Kristeva has offered a provocative analysis about how changes in subjectivity have precipitated a loss of revolt in contemporary society. She argues that the psychic inability to revolt can be linked to the advent of the society of the spectacle, in which the creative capacity of our imagination and our fantasies becomes stunted. In this course, we will explore Kristevaâ€™s claim via her engagement with three figures: Lacan, Debord, and Sartre. We will pay particular attention to the way in which she critiques and extends the notion of the imaginary in psychoanalysis, the notion of the spectacle in social theory, and the notion of the imagination in phenomenology to theorize this link between the psychic life of the subject and the social world.
