---

The course introduces classical Critical Theory, a field of social theory, that is primarily
concerned with understanding capitalist society with the aim of overcoming it. Concepts like
Reification and Fetishism become crucial for formulating a critique of the real and abstract
social, political, and economic processes of Capitalism. After this introduction we will focus
on Critical Theory after the 1970s in the context of the rise of neoliberal capitalism.
The course requires consistent reading and preparation as well as a significant writing
assignment workload. Students will be required to submit reading responses, a class
presentation, and two essay papers. All the readings will be shared in a DropBox folder.
