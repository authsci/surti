Ian Anthony Morrison is an Associate Professor of Sociology and Chair of the Sociology, Egyptology and Anthropology department at the American University in Cairo. He holds a PhD in Sociology from York University, a MA in Political Economy from Carleton University, and completed early-stage training at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Society. His research engages with questions of the nation, identity, religion, memory and political subjectivity through the use of continental social thought and psychoanalytic theory. His monograph, Nation, Crisis and Reproduction: Religion and National Identity in Qu√©bec (University of British Columbia Press), explores moments of crisis through which national identity, and consequently, the nation are both reconstituted and reproduced. His current research examines the manner in which events which are deemed collective traumas are conceptualized and incorporated into conceptions of history and identity in a series of Western and non-Western contexts.
