During his fellowship year (2019-2020), Adham will focus his research on examining a link between Lacanian psychoanalysis and Marx's method of inquiry. He will be looking at the work of scholars in the Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis and their readings of Lacan, Hegel, and Marx.

Adham holds a Master of Arts in Political Science from the American University in Cairo. His thesis explores Marx's theoretical apparatuses and eurocentrism.
