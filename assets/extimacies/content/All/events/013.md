**Psychoanalysis and Politics**

<br>

This two session colloquium focused on extimacy as a psychoanalytical concept. For the first time, our sections deal with our central concept, considering its genesis in psychoanalysis and their interconnection with philosophy as well. In this sense, the first section was based on David Pavón-Cuéllar´s article “Extimacy” for the Encyclopedia of Critical Psychology.  The second section dealt with Lacan’s essay "The Mirror-phase as Formative of the Function of the I." These readings impelled us to a more detailed discussion about extimacy as a political and epistemological concept regarding object-subject relations.
