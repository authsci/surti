**Singular, Particular, and Universal Colloquium**

<br>

Questions on Marx (March-May 2019): In this colloquium, we explored contemporary readings of Karl Marx, with a focus on issues pertaining to “the singular, particular, and universal”. The reading list was ordered with the specific purpose of facilitating a deeper understanding of the historical-logical components of Marx’s Capital through the work of contemporary thinkers such as Herbert Marcuse, Slavoj Žižek, and Moishe Postone. The general idea was to explore parallel readings of Marxian dialectics while rethinking such fundamental concepts as “labor,” “value” and “abstraction” in connection with the dialectical relations between the abstract and the concrete universal, particular mediations, and the singular one finds within historical materialism.
