**Pathologies of the Colonial**

<br>

Pathologies of the Colonial (July-August/2019) had as its focus the beginnings of a transition from Marx to Psychoanalysis. We continued to discuss Marxâ€™s Capital but now with a greater focus on historical materials, in particular those pertaining to colonialism. In general, this round allowed us to explore and debate the relations between Critical and Decolonial Theories. Consequently, our initial readings included works by, among others, Amy Allen, Frantz Fanon, and George Ciccariello-Maher, whom we regard as essential interlocutors for the Extimacies project as a whole. From these readings, it has become clear to us that dialectics and decolonial theories can be of great assistance to one another, even if they each begin from different conceptions of how to think the social world through historical conditions.
