**The Singular, Particular, and Universal**

<br>


In this two-day international workshop, we aim to explore how Critical Theory and Psychoanalysis intersect to produce contemporary radical critique, with particular attention to this articulation in the Global South. Scholars and psychoanalysts based in Brazil, Mexico, Lebanon and Egypt will share their research in talks, keynote lectures and a reading workshop. Keynote participants include Vladimir Safatle, author of Grand Hotel Abyss, and Ray Brassier, author of Nihil Unbound.
